# Travel Our App Project Readme Report

## Introduction

- **Name:** Ritik Tiwari
- **Current Pursuit:** Computer Science and Engineering
- **Project:** "Travel Our"
- **Project Advisor:** Suyash Kumar Agnihotri

The "Travel Our" project aims to develop a user-friendly travel application to simplify the travel experience. The project is currently underway, and its main focus is to tackle the challenges associated with accurate navigation and coordination during group travel.

## Project Status

### Screens Developed

1. **Splash Screen**: Initial screen when the app is launched.
2. **Login Screen**: Allows users to log in.
3. **Register Screen**: Enables new users to create an account.
4. **Homepage**: Features bottom navigation with options for Home, Settings, Profile, and Groups.
5. **Navigation Drawer**: Accessible from the Homepage, displaying user information.
6. **Settings Screen**: Displays user profile picture, name, email, contact information, and unique vehicle ID.
7. **Profile Screen**: Shows detailed information about trips taken by the logged-in user.
8. **Groups Screen**: Displays trips taken by all users, including the username of the traveler.
9. **Map Display**: Included in the Home section for a visual representation of user's current location.

### Firebase Integration

- The app is integrated with Firebase for efficient data management.
- Registered user information, contact details, and trip data are stored in the Firebase database.
- Real-time updates of user trips are facilitated using Firebase Realtime Database.

### Achievements

- Successfully integrated the app with Firebase database, storing and retrieving user and trip data.

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Layout Complexity**: Managing various interconnected layouts for seamless navigation. The solution involves a structured layout hierarchy to ensure smooth transitions between screens.
2. **Database Structure**: Designing the Firebase database structure to prevent lag or crashes when fetching real-time data. A well-organized structure was established to ensure efficient data retrieval.
3. **Real-time Maps**: Integrating real-time maps into the app remains a challenge. This is an ongoing effort, and solutions are being explored to address this issue.

## Future Plans

1. **Real-time Maps**: Integrate real-time maps to display users' current locations during travel.
2. **App Debugging**: Perform thorough debugging to enhance user reliability and overall app performance.

## Project Timeline

- Remaining work deadline: April 25th, in preparation for majors.
- Continued efforts to address challenges and improve the app's functionality.

## Conclusion

The "Travel Our" project, under the guidance of Suyash Kumar Agnihotri, aims to create a user-friendly travel application. The project has successfully developed various screens, integrated Firebase for data management, and tackled challenges related to layouts, database structure, and real-time maps. Future plans involve addressing the remaining challenges, integrating real-time maps, and performing comprehensive app debugging to enhance user experience and reliability. The project is progressing as planned, and efforts continue to bring the vision to fruition.
